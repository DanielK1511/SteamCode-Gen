<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A small little project of mine, which is used to generate steam keys.
These are random generated keys without special algorithms or anything.
The generated Keys are most likely not working, or at least are not intended to work.

Uses inline JS in HTML.
You are free to use this without credit.
